        My name is Chris. I am 24 years old and originally from Lees Summit, Missouri and now I currently reside in Neosho, Missouri with my husband Jackson Lewis-Hite and two Dogs Winnie and Rowdy. <br> <br>Jackson and I have been together for 8 years and married for 2. I currently work for La-Z-boy at that their manufacturing facility in Neosho as an upholsterer. My husband is a CIS instructor at OTC, so I have decided to take advantage of the free tuition perks from that and take my first coding class.<br><br>

Over the summer, we spent much of our time finishing half of our basement to move our gameroom/entertainment room downstairs. We were able to complete oneside with the help of a few friends, and family. Our plans are to finish the other side to include a bar and table top board game area. My hobbies include, but are not limited to playing video games, restoring old tractors and soon a truck, roller skating, baking, and spending time with our two dogs.</p>
